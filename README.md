# JavaScript Inspect Element Activator

This JavaScript snippet enables the inspect element feature in the Android browser using the Eruda library. It injects the necessary script into the webpage, allowing you to inspect and debug the DOM, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

1. Open the Android browser on your device.
2. Navigate to the webpage where you want to activate the inspect element feature.
3. In the browser's address bar, type `javascript:` followed by the provided code:

   ```javascript
   javascript:(function () {
     var script = document.createElement('script');
     script.src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eruda";
     document.body.appendChild(script);
     script.onload = function () {
       eruda.init();
     };
   })();
   ```

4. Press Enter to execute the code.
5. The inspect element feature should now be activated, allowing you to inspect and debug the webpage.

Please note that this script assumes the Eruda library is hosted on the CDN provided (`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eruda`). If the library's location changes or is unavailable, you may need to modify the `script.src` URL accordingly.

## Important Considerations

- The inspect element feature is intended for development and debugging purposes. Use it responsibly and avoid manipulating or modifying websites without proper authorization.
- This script activates the inspect element feature in the Android browser only. It may not work or have different effects in other browsers or platforms.
- Make sure you are executing the script in a trusted environment to avoid potential security risks.
- Keep in mind that the functionality provided by the inspect element feature can vary depending on the browser and its version.
